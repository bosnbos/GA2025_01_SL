# Lasso, ridge or relaxed lassso?

Given that some predictors appear to have weak effects on *CLASS* and
the number of predictors is moderate (k = 58), regularized models like
Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net are good choices. Standard logistic
regression is not viable in this setting due to the high-dimensional
structure, which can lead to perfect separation—a scenario where a
hyperplane classifies the training data perfectly, preventing the model
from converging (see below). Lasso may introduce bias through shrinkage,
but its variance reduction can improve test-set performance. Relaxed
Lasso is also used to refit an OLS model on selected variables, reducing
bias while maintaining sparsity.

- **Logistic regression** is a reasonable baseline, but it can perform
  poorly when predictors are highly correlated or when the number of
  variables is large. In such cases, it may overfit or fail to converge
  due to perfect separation.
- **Ridge regression** is better suited to datasets with many correlated
  predictors. It retains all variables but shrinks their coefficients,
  reducing overfitting and potentially improving predictive accuracy.
- **Lasso regression** performs automatic feature selection by shrinking
  some coefficients to zero. It is most effective when we believe that
  only a subset of variables truly contributes to the outcome, making it
  ideal for building sparse, interpretable models.
- **Relaxed Lasso** may be preferred when Lasso is too aggressive. After
  selecting variables, it reduces bias by partially refitting
  coefficients, often improving generalization without sacrificing
  sparsity.

Ridge, as expected, selects all predictor variables. The two criteria
yield a different value of lambda. interesting to check the distribution
of the coefficients. The plot suggests that no penalization might work
well ( lambda = 0).

    ## 4 Relaxed Lasso 0.9718954 0.9232440

\*Among the four models evaluated, Relaxed Lasso achieved the highest
AUC (0.973) while maintaining strong accuracy (91.89%), suggesting it
balances variable selection and coefficient stability effectively. Lasso
also performed well, with slightly lower AUC (0.962) but the highest
accuracy (92.11%). Ridge lagged behind slightly in both metrics,
indicating less effective feature selection. Elastic Net offered a
middle ground between Ridge and Lasso. Overall, Relaxed Lasso provides
the best trade-off between predictive power and generalization, making
it the most robust choice for this classification task. Regularization
clearly improves performance over standard logistic regression.\*\*
